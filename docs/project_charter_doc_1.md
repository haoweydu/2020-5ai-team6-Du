# Project Title: 
_Arietta_
### Start Date: 
24/10/2019
### Project Manager: 
Haowei Du
### Project Sponsor: 
ITIS G.Marconi
### Customer: 
ITIS.G.Marconi
### Users: 
ITIS.G.Marconi Administration
### Stakeholders and Expectations: 
Team: We hope to complete the project within the time limit.  
Professor: Have the software ready to be used by the end of the time limit.
### Purpose:
The school needs a way to keep track of the temperature, the humidity and the sound intensity of the classrooms during the year.
### Goals and Objectives: 
Our goal is to create a system capable of measuring the temperature, the humidity and the sound intensity in a room. The data will then be stored in a database and used by a website to display the informations to the school administration.
### Schedule Information: 
During our first two months of work we have been focused on dividing the tasks, learning new tool such as Arduino and creating the databases and the website pages.
### Financial Information:
Since the school already had all the materials needed we did not have to invest money in the project.
### Project Priorities and degrees of freedom: 
The documentation and the project must all be completed within their respective deadlines.
We are free to organize our work in the way we prefer.
### Approach: 
During the week we work three hours on the documentation and two hours on the project.
### Constraints:
Before we can get our system up and running it must be reviewed by the teachers and by the school administration.
### Assumptions: 
-The Arduino will have access to the local network of the school.  
-The database will be stored on a machine inside the school.  
-The website will be hosted by the school.
-The website will be using a domain given from the school.
### Success Criteria:
The project will be a success if we manage to complete the documentation and the product within the limit without any problem.
### Scope: 
The school administration must be able to see the statistics of the measurements displayed by graphs on the website.
### Risks and obstacles to success:
We lack experience in using Arduino and creating complex interconnected systems, also
the modules for Arduino could be defective or not suited for our tasks.
