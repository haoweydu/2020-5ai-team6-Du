# Project Title: 
_Arietta_
### Start Date: 
24/10/2019
### Project Manager: 
Haowei Du
### Project Sponsor: 
Prof.Cobello  
Prof. Nicola Drago  
### Customer: 
ITIS.G.Marconi
### Users: 
ITIS.G.Marconi Administration
### Stakeholders and Expectations: 
Team: We hope to complete the project within the time limit.
Professor: Have the software ready to be used by the end of the time limit.
### Purpose:
The school needs a way to keep track of the temperature, the humidity and the sound intensity of the classrooms during the year.
### Goals and Objectives: 
Our goal is to create a system capable of measuring the temperature, the humidity and the sound intensity in a room. The data will then be stored in a database and used by a website to display the informations to the school administration.
### Schedule Information: 
### Financial Information:
Since the school already had all the materials needed (Arduino, modules and website domain) we did not have to invest money in the project.
### Project Priorities and degrees of freedom: 
The documentation and the project must all be completed within their respective deadlines.
### Approach: 
During the week we work three hours on the documentation and two hours on the project.
We are free to organize our work in the way we prefer.
### Constraints:
### Assumptions:
### Success Criteria:
### Scope: 
The school administration must be able to see the statistics of the measurements displayed by graphs on the website.
### Risks and obstacles to success:
We lack experience in using Arduino and creating complex interconnected systems, also
the modules for Arduino could be defective or not suited for our tasks.
