# MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING 

## Purpose
The purpose of this Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is to serve as a written understanding between 

the school and our team. 

This MOU documents the responsibilities of the main organizations involved in the development of the Arietta Project.

## Objectives, Scope, and Major Activities

### Objective: 

The objective of Arietta Project is to give the school a tool to keep track of the temperature, the humidity and the sound intensity in the building.

### Scope: 
The measured data will be displayed on a website and it will be used to calculate stats about the temperature, the humidity and the sound intensity.

### Major Activities: 
The data about temperature, humidity and noise will be measured using specific sensors for Arduino. 
We will realize a website and some databases to store this data and display it in a user friendly way.

## Responsibilities
Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Program/Custodian Office
As the principal FCC representative for the System being deployed functional area, Marconi App 
is the proponent for the System being deployed and is ultimately responsible for review and validation of 
the system documentation and proposed system modifications. 

In addition, Marconi App will:

1. Seek support for, program for, budget, and provide the funding necessary for successful integration of the system,
including all necessary information assurance, data and computer security requirements;

2. Ensure that appropriate ITC program managers and the Customer Service Representative are kept appraised 
of any planned or proposed system modifications so that adequate time for consideration can be offered to the system;

3. Ensure that required strategic functional plan for system name are developed;

4. Provide all required information pertaining to the system, its characteristics and configuration to allow FCC personnel 
to classify the system as required by OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III and other Federal mandates;

5. Ensure compliance with all applicable Federal mandates with regard to computer-based system usage; and

6. Sign this agreement and act in the best interest of the FCC to ensure continued availability and integrity 
of system name and associated data.

### MOU Spiaggiari
The MOU Spiaggiari, AAT will provide all necessary computer based services to the FCC, 
AAT ensure successfully deployment of Marconi App. 

In addition the MOU Spiaggiari will:

Provide strategic guidance and oversight to FCC, Marconi App on the secure and adequate 
implementation of system name;

Ensure that baseline agreements on system availability, reliability and accessibility 
are met or otherwise highlighted and discussed with the FCC, AAT;

Define/redefine requirements and push solutions/capabilities to the FCC as quickly as possible;

Ensure system alternatives and solutions will be supportable and usable by FCC users;

Perform the systems engineering, test, configuration management, and total integration effort
in concert with FCC points of contact.  

Define the system architecture, interfaces and develop 
support concepts for the FCC system(s);

Work with the other signatories of this MOU to ensure total program involvement and understanding 
is reached and to ensure the program is executed in a successful manner and the goals are met;

Exercise the functional responsibility for the management of system name, reporting to the FCC point 
of contact on all issues concerning integration of processes and data in the system; and

Monitor execution of the services provided by system name, including the infrastructure efforts 
required ensuring continued availability.

## Services
All services provided under this MOU shall be highlighted in this section, including but not limited to:

Description of the information system architecture;

Description of communication links;

Description of system specific algorithms to be implemented;

Advanced notification of any planned system modifications, including client modifications;

Testing that will be done internally at both ends of the interface;

Support and resource required by both the FCC and the management agency;
