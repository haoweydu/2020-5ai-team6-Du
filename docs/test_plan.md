Arietta Software Test Plan

#

# INTRODUCTION

This exercise essentially discovers faults and failures in the software. Faults lead to failures and testing is necessary to eliminate these errors in the software development process. The following document outlines the testing procedures for the Team 2 software project.

## Items and Features Tested

The features tested include the user interface and the functionalities.

## Test Specifications

This section highlights the different levels of testing performed during the software development process. It includes integrations tests performed by the team tester and system tests performed by a team of testers to verify that the system fulfills the requirements and performs as expected. The complete testing procedures are outlined in the test specifications document.

## Test Reports

Test reportsoffer feedback about the testing exercise and are informational to project stakeholders. The reports in this testing exercise track incidents, defects, and changeswhile testing the system.

Incident reports track descriptions of incidents, the originator, severity and priority, steps required to produce the defect, the responder, current status, cause, resolution and date the incident was addressed. The document will also track in what phase of the development process the incident was created or detected.

Defect reportsreference the unique identifier in the incident report, list affected items, the owner, required changes, status, phases where the defect was introduced and detected,and general comments or notes.

Change reportssummarize the total number of unit tests, integration tests, and system tests, the items and features tested, comprehensiveness of the assessment, the total number of incidents and defects, and unresolved incidents.

## Project Plan

The project plan reconciles the time schedule and release of candidates with the unit, integration, and system testing.

## Quality Assurance Plan

Yet to be defined.


# ITEMS AND FEATURES TESTED

## Bulletin Board

Bulletin board testing takes place in the integration and system testing. The tester will test functions of the project during integration, will retest them after features are added to make sure they still function correctly.

Test items:

- user acces the website
- user access our data
- user try to interact with our website


# APPROACH

## Strategy

The testing approach includes team members acting as users that use the website.

We try every possible approach to see any faults

## Techniques/Tools

In the continuation of the test, errors and problems will be marked with a list.

## Test Goals

The goals of this testing exercise include finding various user situations and testing against these situations in order to discover any errors that may cause failures. The ultimate goal is to ensure that the team delivers an error-free functioning system.


# TEST DELIVERABLES

- A test plan that delineates the testing phase of the development process
- A test specification document detailing steps in the testing procedures
- Test reports documenting incidents, defects and changes

# TESTING TASKS

Testing tasks for integration and system testing are outlined in the test specification document.

# SCHEDULE

Testing will occur at each phase of the development process. Test cases are outlined in the test specification document for the iterations.
