# OVERVIEW 
## Purpose and Scope
Our team is interested in realizing a system that the ITIS G.Marconi' s administration will use to keep track of data regarding the temperature, the humidity and the noise intensity of the classrooms.
The users will access the stats regarding the data throgh some graphs displayed on the official website of the project.

## Goals and Objectives
The overall objective is to give the school an easy way to keep track of the temperature, humidity and noise intensity.
Project goals:
1. Learn how to use Arduino
2. Learn how to use SQL, PHP, HTML, CSS and Google Chart.

Project objectives:  
1. Create a database inside of which we can store the data.
2. Write the code to make the Arduino able to use its modules to collect the data.
3. Create the website (the interface for the users) on which the stats will be displayed.

## Project Deliverables
At the end of the period we will deliver all the stuff that is contained into our repository to the school: the Arduino code, the databases and the webpages.

## Assumptions and Constraints
### Assumptions
We assume that at the end of the first period we'll have a beta version of the project and that the school will give us the hosting for the webpages and the domain.
### Constraints
The project must be delivered with all its relative documentation and must be completed within the deadline.

## Schedule and Budget Summary
### Cost Estimate
Since the school had all the materials we needed  the cost of the project is null.
### Schedule Summary
We started working on the project on the 24/20/2019 and it must be completed within the deadline.
The documentation must be delivered within  this date: 5/01/2019.

## Success Criteria
The project will be a success if by the end of the period our system will be ready to get up and running.
