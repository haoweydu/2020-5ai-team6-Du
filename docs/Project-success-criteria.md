# Success Criteria for Arietta

##### The Arietta will be considered a success if . . .
### A fully functional test system is delivered on or before June 2th.
The system shall be delivered in a state that is ready to be used in its intended production environment for its intended purpose. 

The users shall be given the training they need in order to begin using the system. 

We will consider both of these goals met if the users who plan to use the system during its test period fill out the attached Acceptance Test User Survey and:

No one circles “No” on the first two questions

If anyone circles “Yes, with reservations” on the first two questions, these reservations shall be resolved prior to April 4th to the satisfaction of the users with the reservations

### Concerns raised during the test period are addressed according to the problem resolution plan contained in the Software Project Management Plan

All critical defects found before June 2th will be fixed. 

A critical defect is one for which there is no convenient workaround. 

Beyond fixing defects, requested changes will be handled on a sliding scale. 

Changes taking 30 hours or less will be done if notified of the change 3 weeks before the scheduled end of the project. 

Changes taking 20 hours or less will be done if notified of the change 2 weeks before the scheduled end of the project. 

Changes taking 10 hours or less will be done if notified of the change 1 week before the scheduled end of the project.

Users shall be notified of their rights and responsibilities under this policy prior to the start of acceptance test.

### Community Marconi can easily log into the system.
This specifically means that a Youth will be able to select the login option, type their first and last name or some portion of their first and/or last name.

### Arietta supervisors can create and edit user accounts.
All data should be editable from the Internet interface.

### The production database is updated.
Data from Arietta's existing database is uploaded to the new system. 

Data from all fields in the existing database shall be migrated to corresponding fields in the new database.

### The System is properly documented.
First, a user manual shall be produced and included with the system. 

This user manual shall be easy to understand for non-technical users familiar with basic Internet and spreadsheet concepts. 

This manual shall explain only how to use all features of the system.

Second, a system manual shall be produced. 

This system manual shall consist of the architecture document, as well as any additional material required to provide a technician with all necessary information needed to maintain and update the system.

A single read through of this document and no more than 2 hours looking at the code should provide an appropriately skilled technician with all the information necessary to understand the system and make simple changes such as add a field to a generated report.

Known defects are entered into the Bugzilla defect tracking system

After June 2th defects that are found but not fixed immediately (less than 24 hours) will be entered into the Bugzilla defect tracking system. 

At the end of the project there shall be no unresolved defects with severity blocker or critical.
